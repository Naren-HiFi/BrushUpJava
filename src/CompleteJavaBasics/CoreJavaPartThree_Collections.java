                                Collections
The Java Collections Framework is a collection of interfaces and classes which helps in storing
and processing the data efficiently. This framework has several useful classes that have tons of
useful functions, which makes a programmer task super easy

List

A list is an interface and is an ordered collection (sometimes called a sequence).
Lists may contain duplicate elements.

Below are classes implement List Interface

=> ArrayList
=> LinkedList
=> Vector

Set

A set is an interface and is a collection that can't contain duplicate elements.

However, it makes no guarantee concerning the order of iteration

Below are classes that implement List interface

=> HashSet
=> LinkedHashSet
=> TreeSet


Map

A map is an interface and an object that maps keys to values. A map can't contain duplicate keys.

Below are classes that implement Map interfaces


=> HashMap
=> LinkedHashMap
=> TreeMap
=> HashTable
