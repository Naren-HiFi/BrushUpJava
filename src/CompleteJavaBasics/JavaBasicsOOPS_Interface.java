Interface has methods but it has no body (There is no code inside method)

Eg: Real time traffic scenario

Green - You should move
Red - You should stop
Flashing yellow - wait

There are the basic rules that are imposed by the centralised traffic team and these rules should be followed by all the
countries top over this you can add your own rules however you should follow the base rule that needs to be followed by
all the countries across the world.

// Classes should define and implement the methods present in the interface.

Let me cite you a classic example:

Imagine Australia has a specific set of traffic rules. But the basic traffic aforementioned rules that needs to be implemented
inside the australia class in the first place.

class Australia{

greenSignal(){}
redSignal(){}
yellowSignal(){}


}
